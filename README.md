### Project title

*Give your project a nice title.*

Simple Supply Chain Management System (SCMS)

### What and why?

*What software system would you like to build this semester, and why? Include a description of what problem the system would solve and why this is important.*

We propose building a Simple Supply Chain Management System (SCMS) designed to streamline and automate key supply chain processes for small-scale retail operations. The system focuses on two critical areas: inventory & supplier management and order processing collaboration.

The problem this system solves is the inefficient manual management of inventory and orders in small retail businesses like pharmacies and convenience stores. Many such businesses still rely on paper-based systems or basic spreadsheets, leading to inventory errors, delayed reordering, and poor supplier coordination. By automating these processes, the system will reduce human error, prevent stock-outs, and improve overall operational efficiency.

### For whom?

*Who will this software be for? These people are your end-users or customers.

Do not make software for imaginary users who do not exist - you must have real people as your initial end-users. Tell us who they are. For example, is it for a particular type of business, mass consumer, a campus office, a professor, or friends or family, or ... people just like you.

Understanding who your end-users are, and ideally speaking with some along the way, will help you refine your designs to be suitable for your audience, and understand whether you have succeeded at the end or not.*


This software is specifically designed for small-sized pharmacies and convenience stores. The system will serve multiple end-users within these businesses:

- Inventory managers who need to monitor stock levels and manage supplier relationships
- Stock clerks who handle the physical receipt and dispatch of products
- Sales managers who process customer orders
- Customers who place and track their orders

### How?

*A description of what the system will do from an end-user's perspective. Be as complete as necessary to fully explain the system, but do not worry about technical implementation - this will be developed in subsequent work.*

The system consists of two main modules:

1. Inventory & Supplier Management Module
- Inventory managers can view real-time stock levels, supplier details, and initiate reorders
- Stock clerks can record incoming products, assign storage locations, and process outgoing orders
- The system maintains detailed inventory history and supplier information


2. Sales Processing Module
- Customers can create orders, modify them before processing, and track order status
- Sales managers can monitor new orders and generate picking lists for stock clerks
- The system maintains a comprehensive order history

All operations will be handled sequentially to ensure data consistency and avoid conflicts.

### Scope

*A brief justification that the proposal is neither too easy nor too ambitions for a group of approximately 4 - 6 programmers to undertake in one semester.*

This project is appropriately scoped for a 4-6 person team over one semester. The system's focus on small retail operations eliminates the need to handle complex manufacturing processes, making it more manageable. The sequential processing model significantly simplifies implementation by avoiding concurrent operations and complex synchronization issues. The project has clearly defined modules that team members can develop in parallel, allowing for efficient distribution of work. While the core functionality is well-defined, the system architecture allows for additional features if time permits. The existence of similar systems in the market provides valuable reference points for design decisions, reducing uncertainty in the development process. The project offers enough complexity through its database design, multiple user interfaces, and order processing logic to be challenging and educational, while remaining achievable within the semester timeframe.







## Submission

Complete the assignment as a Markdown document in the file named `README.md` in this repository. The document should be nicely formatted and outlined with a clear heading and sub-headings for each section.

Use the `git` features of **Visual Studio Code** to commit your work and `push` them to the GitHub repository.

Share the link to your document in your private assignments Discord channel AND in the public `#project-ideas` channel. In both cases, include the title of your project for all to see in the message.

## What happens next

We will select a subset of the proposals that we think will be the most interesting and appropriate for this course. These will be published to the class. Your next assignment will be to rank your favorites. We will then make team assignments based on this information and the answers you have provided to the previous introductory questionnaire.

If your proposal is selected, you are 99% guaranteed to be part of that team.
